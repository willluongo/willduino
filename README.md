My solo arduino projects, with code and schematics.

Why the terrible directory structure??!
---------------------------------------

Basically this format allows the projects to be compiled/uploaded using [ino](https://github.com/amperka/ino "ino tool") or the [original Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software "Arduino IDE") without modifying anything else (with the exception of adding a `lib` directory until ino people fix a bug).
